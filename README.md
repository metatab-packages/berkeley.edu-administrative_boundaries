# International Adminstrative Boundaries

A collection of second level administrative boundaries, by country, for a select group of countries ( the countries that have the most special exconomic zones. ) 

The China city boundaries file was loaded into QGis from Berkeley's Web Feature Service, then saved as CSV with WKT geometries, but the rest are direct links to Berkeley's geographic file store.

The second level administrative regions files appear to originally come from Stanford, from the [Global administrative areas](https://searchworks.stanford.edu/view/12276480) collection.
